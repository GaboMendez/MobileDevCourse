# Homework 4 - Consume a RestAPI

Description: 
- Use the API of your finale project, making a request to that and displaying the data on the screen.

- Every member of the team must use a different endpoint

- The app must validate that there is Internet connection before doing the request, otherwise it should display an error message.

- You must elaborate this homework with the steps we saw in the course (Create an API Service folder, create an interface, etc.)
