# Homework 1 - Login Page

Description: 
Pick any page layout (Master Detail Page, Tabbed Page, Content Page, Navigation Page) and create a Login Page on it. You can use any design you want but it should contain as minimum an image, 2 entries and a button.

Validations:
- When you click on the "Login" button it must validate that the 2 entries are not empty and show an alert if they are. If they're not empty it must show an alert saying "Welcome", "Hi, (username that appears on the username entry)".

- Password must be hidden (Use property isPassword="true")
